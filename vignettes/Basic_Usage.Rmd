# Introduction


Welcome to the `atr` vignette! This guide will delve deeper into the functionalities offered by the package-

Before diving in, let's clarify some terminology. In the context of Blue Sky, a post is referred to as a "skeet." So, when we mention retrieving or working with "skeets," we are talking about individual posts made on Blue Sky.

Now, let's delve deeper into the functionalities that allow users to interact with skeets, followers, and their descriptions.

## Installation

If you haven't done so, you can install the development version of atr like so (`pak` works similar to `remotes` here, but it's what the cool kids use now :grin:):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("JBGruber/atr")
```


## Load the package

```{r setup}
library(atr)
```

## Authentication

The first time you make a request, you will be prompted automatically to enter your user handle and an app password to authenticate `atr` to communicate with BlueSky for you.

The page to generate app passwords is also automatically opened for you.

However, you can also trigger this process manually:

```{r eval=FALSE}
auth("jbgruber.bsky.social")
```

This can be useful if you want to replace an old token as it is permanently stored encrypted on disk.

# Searching Posts

The AT protocol defines a search function at `app.bsky.feed.searchPosts`, however, it is not currently active, as far as we could tell.

As soon as the functionality is added by BlueSky, we will implement it here.


# Blue Sky Users and Skeets

This are the most basic operations you probably want to employ when working with social media data.


## Retrieve user info (`get_user_info`)

A good starting point is understanding a user's digital footprint on the platform. The get_user_info function becomes our handy tool, fetching an array of information about a user. All you need? Their handle!


```{r}
get_user_info(actor = "atpr.bsky.social")  |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

This function gives us counts of followers, follows, posts for each user.

You can also retrieve information for multiple users by providing a vector of user handles:

```{r}
get_user_info(actor = c("benguinaudeau.bsky.social", "atpr.bsky.social"))  |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```


## Retrieve Skeets (`get_skeets_authored_by`)

To fetch all the skeets by a specific user, use the `get_skeets_authored_by` function. *Note this also includes quote skeets and reskeets.* You can also opt not to parse the result by setting `parse = FALSE`, however it is recommended to use the default parse option which results in a (more) tidy tibble.

```{r}
get_skeets_authored_by(actor = "benguinaudeau.bsky.social", parse = TRUE) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

Feeling adventurous? Increase the `limit` and explore more of their content.

```{r}
get_skeets_authored_by(actor = "favstats.bsky.social", limit = 30) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```
