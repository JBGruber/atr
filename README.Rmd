The goal of atr is to wrap the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol) behind Bluesky.
And we have actually already fulfilled this goal!
The entire protocol is open and documented in so-called [lexicons](https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon), from which we autogenerated `R` functions.
These are not exported, however, since dealing with them is a bit advanced.
Rather we have some nice human-generated functions with documentation and examples.
Start with the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) section below to learn more.

## Installation

You can install the development version of atr like so (`pak` works similar to `remotes` here, but it's what the cool kids use now :grin:):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("JBGruber/atr")
```

# Basic Usage

```{r, child="vignettes/Basic_Usage.Rmd"}
```

# Want to help?

You can help by creating an [issue](https://github.com/JBGruber/atr/issues/new/choose) requesting new features or reporting bugs.
If you are a developer, we are happy to accept pull requests.
It should be fairly straightforward, as all endpoints are already covered by automatically generated function.
But please open an issue first, so we don't do duplicated work.
