The goal of atr is to wrap the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer
Protocol) behind Bluesky. And we have actually already fulfilled this
goal! The entire protocol is open and documented in so-called
[lexicons](https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon), from which we
autogenerated `R` functions. These are not exported, however, since
dealing with them is a bit advanced. Rather we have some nice
human-generated functions with documentation and examples. Start with
the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) section below to learn more.

## Installation

You can install the development version of atr like so (`pak` works
similar to `remotes` here, but it’s what the cool kids use now :grin:):

``` r
# install.packages("pak)
pak::pak("JBGruber/atr")
```

# Basic Usage(#basic-usage)

``` r
library(atr)
```

## Searching Posts

The AT protocol defines a search function at
`app.bsky.feed.searchPosts`, however, it is not currently active, as far
as we could tell. As soon as the functionality is added by BlueSky, we
will implement it here.

# Want to help?

You can help by creating an
[issue](https://github.com/JBGruber/atr/issues/new/choose) requesting
new features or reporting bugs. If you are a developer, we are happy to
accept pull requests. It should be fairly straightforward, as all
endpoints are already covered by automatically generated function. But
please open an issue first, so we don’t do duplicated work.
