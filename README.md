The goal of atr is to wrap the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer
Protocol) behind Bluesky. *And we have actually already fulfilled this
goal!*

The entire protocol is open and documented in so-called
[lexicons](https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon), from which we
autogenerated `R` functions.

These are not exported, however, since dealing with them is a bit
advanced. Rather we have some nice human-generated functions with
documentation and examples.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `atr` like so (install the
`remotes` package first, with `install.packages("remotes")`, if you
don‚Äôt have that yet):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JBGruber/atr")
```

## Load the package

``` r
library(atr)
```

## Authentication

The first time you make a request, you will be prompted automatically to
enter your user handle and an app password to authenticate `atr` to
communicate with BlueSky for you.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">RStudio Popup</figcaption>
</figure>

The page to generate app passwords is also automatically opened for you.

<figure>
<img src="vignettes/figures/app_password.png"
alt="page to create new app passwords" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">page to create new app
passwords</figcaption>
</figure>

However, you can also trigger this process manually:

``` r
auth("jbgruber.bsky.social")
```

This can be useful if you want to replace an old token as it is
permanently stored encrypted on disk.

## Retrieve Skeets (`get_skeets_authored_by`)

To fetch all the skeets by a specific user, use the
`get_skeets_authored_by` function. *Note this also includes quote skeets
and reskeets.* You can also opt not to parse the result by setting
`parse = FALSE`, however it is recommended to use the default parse
option which results in a (more) tidy tibble.

``` r
get_skeets_authored_by(actor = "benguinaudeau.bsky.social", parse = TRUE) |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
#> Rows: 25
#> Columns: 11
#> $ uri          <chr> "at://did:plc:3tve46l2ba37hqp4htuk6idu/app.bsky.feed.post‚Ä¶

## Analyzing Feeds on Blue Sky

On Blue Sky users have the ability to create custom feeds based on
specific keywords. These feeds aggregate content, for instance, a user
might curate a feed around the hashtag `#rstats` to gather all relevant
content about. Let‚Äôs delve into the dynamics of such feeds.

Our starting point is to extract the posts from the `#rstats` feed
created by ‚Äúandrew.heiss.phd‚Äù.

``` r
# Fetching the feed posts
feeds <- get_feeds_created_by(actor = "andrew.heiss.phd") 

# Filtering for a specific keyword, for example "#rstats"
rstat_feed <- feeds |>
  filter(displayName == "#rstats")

# Extracting posts from this curated feed
rstat_posts <- get_feed(rstat_feed$uri, limit = 200) |>
  # Extracting user handle from the author
  mutate(handle = author |> map_chr(~{.x$handle}))  |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
#> Rows: 146
#> Columns: 11

# Want to help?

You can help by creating an
[issue](https://github.com/JBGruber/atr/issues/new/choose) requesting
new features or reporting bugs.

If you are a developer, we are happy to accept pull requests.

It should be fairly straightforward, as all endpoints are already
covered by automatically generated function.

But please open an issue first, so we don‚Äôt do duplicated work.
